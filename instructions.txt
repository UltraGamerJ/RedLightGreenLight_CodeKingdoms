Go to Game File
Make a Field of type int called gamePhase
Make a Field of type bool called greenLight
Add an onCodeUpdate to Game
Set gamePhase to 0 in onCodeUpdate
Set greenLight to false in onCodeUpdate
Broadcast title "Starting Soon!", "Run on green, stop on red!"
(Optional: Add in concatenation to make green and red colored; looks like "( "Run on " + ( ( ChatColor.GREEN + "GREEN" ) + ChatColor.WHITE ) ) + ( ", stop on " + ( ChatColor.RED + "RED" ) ))")?
Set showCountdownTimer to true
Start timer (30 seconds)
Add method onTimerExpire to Game
if gamePhase == 0, broadcast "Get ready...", set gamePhase = 1, set showCountdownTimer to false, and start timer for Random.generateInteger(3, 7)
else if gamePhase == 1
	if greenLight, broadcast "Red light!" and set timeout for 1 second, in which set greenLight to false, after the timeout startTimer for Random.generateInteger(5, 15)
	else, broadcast "Green light!", set greenLight to true, and startTimer for Random.generateInteger(5, 15)
Go to Player File
Add onJoin
if GetGame().gamePhase == 0, teleport(Random.generateInteger(-44, -75), 30, 126), setGameMode(GameMode.ADVENTURE), and set canMove = false
Go back to the Game File
After "else if gamePhase == 1", add a for Player p in getPlayerList(): p.canMove = true
Go back to the Player File
After the end of "if getGame().gamePhase == 0", add else setGameMode(GameMode.SPECTATOR)
Add Method onMove
if getLocation().getZ() >= 472, sendTitle "CONGRATULATIONS!", "You have completed the course!", getGame().broadcastMessage(name + " completed the course!"), and getGame().checkRestart()
if (NOT getGame().greenLight) AND (getGame().gamePhase == 1),
	setGameMode(GameMode.SPECTATOR)
	sendTitle "You failed!", "No moving during Red Light!" and getGame().broadcastMessage(name + " moved during red light and has failed!")
Go to the Game File
Add Method checkRestart()
for Player p in getPlayerList(), 
	if p.getGameMode() == GameMode.ADVENTURE, return
Broadcast message "All players are in spectator! Restarting..."
resetGame()
Go back to Player File
After the end of the else (following if getLocation().getZ() etc), add getGame().checkRestart()
Go back to Game File
After greenLight = false in onCodeUpdate, add for Player p in getPlayerList(), p.setGameMode(GameMode.ADVENTURE) and p.onJoin()
